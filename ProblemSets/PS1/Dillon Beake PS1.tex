\section{Introduction}
My name is Dillon. I am PHD student in Sports Data Analytics/ Exercise Physiology.  I wanted to take this course for a couple of reasons.  The course is part of our Sports Data Analytics program.  And, I have limited coding experience and I am motivated to learn this skill set.  Further, I am very interested in developing the skills this course has to offer.  The research I am interested in doing is an to predict athletic development.  The sport I am interested in studying is American Football.  I would like to use the tools I learn in this class, such as machine learning and web scraping, to gather a large database of key performance indicators in order to analyze them for relationships and predicted outcomes.  I plan to use sources including the NFL's publicly listed combine results. My Goal for this class is to learn the skills necessary to accomplish my research goals.  I want to work for a college or professional sports team as a Sports Scientist after graduation.
