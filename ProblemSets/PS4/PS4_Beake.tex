\section{Data for Research}

I would like to use sports statistics for college, professional and any high-school sources I can find.  I am specifically intereseted in combine information including both key performance indicators, e.g. 40yd, vertical jump, broad jump, pro agility, and body measurements, wingspan, height, weight, hand size, and bod fat if they have it.  These days these combines are completed at the professional level, college level, and high school level. 
  
 Here are some example websites:

1.  https://www.nfl.com/combine/tracker/participants/
2.  https://bluegreyfootball.com/combines/
3.  https://press.cfl.ca/cfl-combine-results-confirmed-and-released
